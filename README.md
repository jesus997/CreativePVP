A KitPvp variation

By jesus997 to iberians.hol.es

Imagine a mini-game where you choose your own kit. CreativePVP is based on Kit PVP with the difference that here the creative menu 
you choose, your own weapons to come out fighting. When the user enters the command '/cp join [nameArena]' is transported to an area 
where the creative enabled. After you have equipped, leaves the lobby to another area where pvp is active, crossing from one zone to 
another the user switches to survival. When the user dies, he is transported back to the lobby where you can choose a new creative kit. 
If the user wants to leave the arena, you have to put the command '/cp leave'. The arena shall consist of a lobby, a starting point 
and an exit point.  

If possible add scoreboard with scores: Kills, Deaths, Coins, kd and kk, arena name or id.
