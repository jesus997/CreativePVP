# CreativePVP+
Imagine a mini-game where you choose your own kit and that does not end. *CreativePVP* is based on Kit PVP with the difference that here the creative menu you choose, your own weapons to come out fighting. When the user enters the command `/cp join [idArena]` is transported to an area where the creative enabled. After you have equipped, leaves the lobby to another area where pvp is active, crossing from one zone to another the user switches to survival. When the user dies, he is transported back to the lobby where you can choose a new creative kit. If the user wants to leave the arena, you have to put the command `/cp leave`. The arena shall consist of a lobby, a starting point and an exit point.
